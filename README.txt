Project: 5 Paycheck Month Finder
Language: Python

Author: Payton Ide

This program was created to allow easy calculation of months in a year with 5 of the same weekday. 
This was prompted by my employer changing from Friday paychecks to Thursday. 
While it was easy to find this infomation with a simple online search for Fridays, I could only find the 5 Thursday months manually. 
Thus, I created this simple calendar generator that returns the list of months with 5 of any inputted day of interest, for any year after 1900.

This has been verified extensively at and around current years, as well as into the future as far as 2100. 
There should not be any issues unless there are some calendar rules I am not aware of. This accounts for all rules of leap years in the standard Gregorian Calendar:
	-Every 4 years
	-Except every 100 years
	-Added back in every 400 years
